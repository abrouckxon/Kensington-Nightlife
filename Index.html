With drinks being a bit on the pricey side, they definitley make up for it in selection. So if your looking for a casual yet lively place to connect definitley checkout The Embassy!

	Since 2004, SuperMarket has been and still is a lively dancehall/ bar combination. With Friday and Saturdays DJ's playing the hits. With the length of the bar having seating on the oppsoite side against the wall in the forms of tables and booths. The back 1/3rd of the establishment having a dancefloor with minimal seating in that area. the vibe of Supermarket can only be described as "An extroverts dream" where in if most people are there just to get drinks they can quickly be convinced to join on the dancefloor it just needs the first few people to break the mold and get everyone on the floor. Personally I have had many experiences where the dancefloor is completley empty but within 5 minutes of someone starting to dance the entire place migrates to the dancefloor. With reasonbly priced drinks and relatively friendly staff SuperMarket is definitley worth a chance!

		Trinity Common is a casual small town feeling bar with candle lit interior, a vivacious patio and frequent live music. Besides being ideal for an after work beer,  The pub food will surely suffice in your pub crawl cravings. I have been known to bar hop kensington with Trinity Common being a great place to start your pub crawl.
